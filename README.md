# Zanzibar
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/zanzibar.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/zanzibar)

Zanzibar is a utility to retrieve secrets from a Secret Server installation. It supports retrieval of a password, public/private key, or secret attachment.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'zanzibar'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zanzibar

## Usage

In your ruby project, rakefile, etc., create a new Zanzibar object.

The constructor takes a hash of optional parameters for the WSDL location, the domain of the Secret Server, a hash of global variables to pass to savon (necessary for windows environments with self-signed certs) and a password for the current user (intended to be passed in through some encryption method, unless you really want a plaintext password there).

All of these parameters are optional and the user will be prompted to enter them if they are missing.

```ruby
  my_object = Zanzibar::Zanzibar.new(:domain => 'my.domain.net', :wsdl => 'my.scrt.srvr.com/webservices/sswebservice.asmx?wdsl', :pwd => get_encrypted_password_from_somewhere)
```

Example:

```ruby
require 'zanzibar'

## Constructor takes hash as argument, all optional :domain, :wsdl, :pwd, :globals
secrets = Zanzibar::Zanzibar.new(:domain => 'mydomain.net', :wsdl => "https://my.scrt.server/webservices/sswebservice.asmx?wsdl")
# On windows with self-signed certs,
# Zanzibar::Zanzibar.new(:domain => 'mydomain.net', :wsdl => "https://my.scrt.server/webservices/sswebservice.asmx?wsdl", :globals => {:ssl_verify_mode => :none})

## Simple password -> takes secret id as argument
secrets.get_password(1234)

## Private Key -> takes hash as argument, requires :scrt_id, :type, optional :scrt_item_id, :path
secrets.download_secret_file(:scrt_id => 2345, :path => 'secrets/', :type => "Private Key")

## Public Key -> takes hash as argument, requires :scrt_id, :type, optional :scrt_item_id, :path
secrets.download_secret_file(:scrt_id => 2345, :path => 'secrets/', :type => "Public Key")

## Attachment; only supports secrets with single attachment -> takes hash as argument, requires :scrt_id, :path, optional :scrt_item_id, :path
secrets.download_secret_file(:scrt_id => 2345, :path => 'secrets/', :type => "Attachment")

```

### Providing Credentials

Zanzibar has several ways of finding Secret Server credentials. It will use credentials
discovered in this order:

* Credentials passed to the initializer
    * `Zanzibar::Zanzibar.new(:username=>'auser', :password=>'itsmyPassword')`
* Credentials discovered via the environment
    * If `ZANZIBAR_USER` exists, it will use that.
        * If not, it will try `USER`
    * If `ZANZIBAR_PASSWORD` exists, it will use that.
* Credentials entered by the user
    * Zanzibar will prompt the user to enter their password on STDIN

### Command Line

Zanzibar comes bundled with the `zanzibar` command-line utility that can be used
for fetching passwords and downloading keys from outside of Ruby scripts.

`zanzibar` supports most actions provided by Zanzibar itself. Because it operates
on the command-line, it can be used as part of a pipeline or within a bash script.

```bash
# if ZANZIBAR_PASSWORD is not set, you will be prompted to enter your password.
# this will download the private key from secret 1984 to the current directory
$ ZANZIBAR_PASSWORD=`gpg -d secretpasswd.txt.gpg` zanzibar get 1984 -s server.example.com -d example.com -f "Private Key"

$ ssh user@someremote -i ./private_key
```

#### Zanzifiles

The `zanzibar` command can also perform [bundler](http://bundler.io)-like actions.
Running `zanzibar init` will generate a `Zanzifile` in the current directory.
Information about Secret Server and the necessary secret files to be downloaded
can be added here.

Then `zanzibar bundle` will try to download the secrets named in the file.
When it downloads a file, it gets added to `Zanzifile.resolved`. And next time
`zanzibar bundle` is run, if the file exists and the hash matches the one in the
`resolved` file, it will not attempt to re-download. `zanzibar update` will attempt
to re-download all secrets.

Note: `zanzibar get` can fetch passwords or files, but `zanzibar bundle` can
only operate on secret files.

Sample `Zanzifile`:

```yaml
---
settings:
  wsdl: my.scrt.srvr.com/webservices/sswebservice.asmx?wsdl
  domain: my.domain.net
  secret_dir: secrets/
  ignore_ssl: true
secrets:
  ssh_key:
    id: 249
    label: Private Key
  encryption_key:
    id: 483
    label: Attachment
  cert_pem:
    id: 123
    label: Certificate
  cert_key:
    id: 986
    label: Misc Attachment
```

Run `zanzibar help` or `zanzibar help [command]` for more information.
